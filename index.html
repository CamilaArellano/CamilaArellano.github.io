            <h1>Welcome to Mesoamerica</h1>
            <p>Five hundred years ago, in ancient Mexico and Central America, a large group of civilizations faced a drastic change in their histories. Spaniards arrived in a new land carrying disease, weapons, ideologies, and a new religion that changed their cultures forever. As a result, today in the countries that emerged from these events, we still see the results of this encounter. This is an invitation to analyze a part of our world that a few centuries ago was known as Mesoamerica.</p>
            <p>Mesoamerica, meaning "Middle America," is a region that extends over present-day Mexico and Central America. It is a cultural area defined by shared features of Indigenous cultural adaptation.</p>
            <p>One of the most important characteristics of this region is the diverse ecosystems that are closely juxtaposed; for example, tropical coasts are only a few hundred kilometres from snow-capped peaks. Mesoamerican culture developed and thrived wherever maize, beans, and squash were staple crops.</p>
            <p>The cultures that inhabited this region had abundant food resources, which not only supported small villages but also allowed civilizations to flourish. Important activities of these cultures included art, agriculture, pottery, and commerce.</p>

            <h1>The Olmecs: Mesoamerica's First Great Culture</h1>
            <p>The cultures in Mesoamerica developed similarly to other cultures around the world, evolving from nomadic hunters to agricultural civilizations. The Olmec culture emerged as Mesoamerica's first highly complex cultural system around 1200 BC, with its most important sites being San Lorenzo and La Venta. Olmec art is recognized as Mesoamerica's first great art style that resonates with modern sensibilities.</p>

                <h3>Colossal Heads</h3>
                <p>The colossal heads are one of the unique characteristics of the Olmecs. These heads are probably portraits of men, likely rulers, featuring ear spools and helmet-like headgear.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Olmec culture declined around 400 BC. Whether they were a "Mother Culture" from which other cultures drew inspiration is debatable, but their influence is undeniable.</p>

            <p>They were a warrior society that expanded their empire through alliances and conquests. Aztec society was highly stratified, with an emperor at the top and slaves at the bottom. They practised human sacrifices as part of their religious rituals to appease their gods, particularly Huitzilopochtli, the god of the sun and war.</p>
            <p>Agriculture, especially maize cultivation, was crucial to their economy, and they developed advanced techniques such as chinampas, or floating gardens.</p>
